# Proper Window Navigation - Fixed! ✅

## Problem
The task tree was created as a **floating window** (`relative = "editor"`), which meant:
- ❌ Couldn't navigate to it with `<C-w>hjkl`
- ❌ Had to close and reopen to access it
- ❌ Not treated as a normal window

## Solution
Changed to a **proper vertical split** window:
- ✅ Uses `botright vsplit` for proper split
- ✅ Navigable with standard `<C-w>hjkl`
- ✅ Persists like any other window
- ✅ Fixed width (25% of screen)

## How to Use

### Opening the Tree
```bash
<leader>tt    # Toggle tree (creates split on right)
```

### Navigating Between Windows
Now you can use **standard Neovim window commands**:

```bash
# From main buffer to tree
<C-w>l        # Move right (to tree)

# From tree back to buffer
<C-w>h        # Move left (to buffer)

# Other navigation
<C-w>j        # Move down
<C-w>k        # Move up
<C-w><C-w>    # Cycle through windows

# Move windows around
<C-w>H        # Move current window to far left
<C-w>L        # Move current window to far right
```

### Workflow Example
```bash
# 1. Open tree
<leader>tt           # Tree opens as split on right

# 2. Work in buffer
<C-w>h              # Go to main buffer
gta                 # Add task
gtx                 # Toggle task

# 3. Check tree
<C-w>l              # Go back to tree
j/k                 # Navigate tasks
x                   # Toggle done
h                   # Hide/show

# 4. Back to work
<C-w>h              # Back to buffer

# 5. Tree stays open, navigate anytime!
<C-w>l              # Back to tree whenever needed
```

## Window Features

The tree window has:
- **Fixed width** - Won't resize when you split other windows
- **No line numbers** - Clean interface
- **Cursor line** - Easy to see current task
- **Proper split** - Acts like nvim-tree, NERDTree, etc.

## Comparison

### Before (Floating Window)
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Main Buffer            │ 
│                         │ ┌─────────────┐
│                         │ │ Floating    │
│                         │ │ Tree        │
│                         │ │ (isolated)  │
└─────────────────────────┘ └─────────────┘
   ↑ Can't navigate with <C-w>hjkl
```

### After (Proper Split)
```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┐
│  Main Buffer    │  Tree Split  │
│                 │              │
│                 │  [1] Task    │
│                 │  [2] Task    │
│                 │              │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┘
  <C-w>h ←→ <C-w>l  (works!)
```

## Benefits

✅ **Navigate freely** - Use `<C-w>hjkl` to move between windows
✅ **Persistent** - Tree stays open, no need to toggle
✅ **Standard behavior** - Works like other sidebar plugins
✅ **Fixed width** - Tree keeps 25% width
✅ **Clean layout** - Proper vertical split

## All Window Commands Work

Since it's a proper window, all standard Neovim window commands work:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `<C-w>hjkl` | Navigate windows |
| `<C-w><C-w>` | Cycle windows |
| `<C-w>H` | Move window left |
| `<C-w>L` | Move window right |
| `<C-w>=` | Equalize window sizes |
| `<C-w>_` | Maximize height |
| `<C-w>\|` | Maximize width |
| `<C-w>q` | Close window |

Perfect! Now you can navigate to the tree like any other window! 🎉
