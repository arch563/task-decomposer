# Final Improvements - Complete! ✅

## 1. Window Navigation with Ctrl+h/l

### Problem Fixed
❌ Couldn't navigate back to tree from buffer using Ctrl+hjkl

### Solution
✅ Global keybindings added:
- **`<C-h>`** - Focus task tree from any buffer
- **`<C-l>`** - Focus main window when in tree

### Usage
```bash
# In main buffer
<C-h>    → Jump to task tree

# In task tree
<C-l>    → Jump back to main buffer
```

## 2. Task Numbering Works Immediately

### Problem Fixed
❌ Task numbers showed as `[?]` until tree was opened/closed

### Solution
✅ Added `build_task_indices()` function that:
- Builds indices without needing tree open
- Called automatically when updating virtual text
- Works from the beginning

### Technical Details
- `ui.build_task_indices()` - Builds indices for all tasks
- Called in `virtual_text.update_buffer()` 
- Ensures indices always available

## 3. Sign-Off Shows Green Tick (No Delete)

### Problem Fixed
❌ Sign-off deleted tasks immediately
❌ Tasks disappeared from buffer

### Solution
✅ Sign-off now:
- Marks tasks as **completed** (not deleted)
- Shows **green tick ✓** in buffer
- Uses **translucent green** highlight
- Tasks remain visible but clearly done

### Visual Example
**Before sign-off:**
```lua
function test()
    code here    ○ Fix this bug [1.2]
                 ^
                 Blue (pending)
```

**After `gts` (sign-off):**
```lua
function test()
    code here    ✓ Fix this bug [1.2]
                 ^
                 Green (completed)
```

### Behavior
- **`gts`** - Signs off all pending tasks in file
- Tasks stay visible with green tick
- Can still toggle them with `gtx`

## 4. Hide/Show Tasks (Tree Only)

### Problem Fixed
❌ No way to hide tasks from virtual text while keeping them in tree

### Solution
✅ New **hide/show** feature:
- Press **`h`** in tree to toggle task visibility
- Hidden tasks show **👁️ icon** in tree
- Hidden tasks **don't appear in buffers**
- Visible in tree for management

### Usage

**In Tree:**
```bash
# Navigate to task
h    → Toggle hide/show
     → "Task marked as hidden"

# Task shows with eye icon:
[1.2] ○ [ ] 👁️ Hidden task @file.lua:10
```

**In Buffer:**
```
your_code()    # Hidden task NOT shown here
```

### Features
- Hidden tasks stored in database (`hidden` field)
- Eye icon (👁️) indicates hidden status
- Can unhide by pressing `h` again in tree
- Perfect for "archived" or "later" tasks

## Visual Indicators

### In Tree
```
[1.2.3] ├─○ [ ] Regular task @file.lua:10
[1.2.4] └─✓ [✓] Done task @file.lua:15
[2.1] ○ [ ] 👁️ Hidden task @file.lua:20
        ^       ^
        |       └─ Hidden indicator
        └─ Completion icon
```

### In Buffer (Virtual Text)
```
your_code()    ○ Pending task [1.2]
               ^   (translucent blue)

your_code()    ✓ Completed task [1.3]
               ^   (translucent green)

               # Hidden tasks don't show
```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Focus and Navigate
```bash
# Working in buffer
<C-h>         → Focus tree
j/k           → Navigate tasks
<C-l>         → Back to buffer
```

### Example 2: Complete and Sign Off
```bash
gtx           → Mark task done (green tick)
gts           → Sign off all pending tasks
              → All pending → completed (green)
```

### Example 3: Hide Distractions
```bash
<C-h>         → Focus tree
/later        → Find "do this later" task
h             → Hide it (👁️ appears)
<C-l>         → Back to buffer
              → Hidden task not shown
```

### Example 4: Task Lifecycle
```bash
# 1. Create
gta           → "Implement feature"

# 2. Work on it
              → Task shows: ○ Implement feature [1]

# 3. Complete
gtx           → Toggle done
              → Task shows: ✓ Implement feature [1]

# 4. Hide from view
<C-h>         → Go to tree
h             → Hide task
              → Shows: [1] ○ [✓] 👁️ Implement feature
<C-l>         → Back to buffer
              → Task no longer in virtual text
```

---

## Database Schema Update

New `hidden` field added:
```lua
{
  id = integer,
  parent_id = integer,
  description = text,
  file_path = text,
  line_number = integer,
  column_number = integer,
  completed = integer (0/1),
  hidden = integer (0/1),    -- NEW!
  created_at = text,
  position = integer,
}
```

---

## Summary of Changes

✅ **Navigation**: `<C-h>` to focus tree, `<C-l>` to return
✅ **Task Numbers**: Work immediately, no tree open needed  
✅ **Sign-Off**: Marks complete (green ✓), doesn't delete
✅ **Hide/Show**: `h` in tree, 👁️ indicator, hidden from buffers

All improvements complete! 🎉
